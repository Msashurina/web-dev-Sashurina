    <h1 id="1">a)When HTML5 has become a standard? What were the main reasons for developing new standard?</h1>
    <dt>HTML5 became a standard in October 2014. The main reasons for developing the new standard were:</dt>
    <dd><p>1.Provide enhanced support for multimedia content;</p></dd>
<dd><p>2.Improve the structure of web documents;</p></dd>
<dd><p>3.Facilitate better cross-platform compatibility.</p></dd>
    
    <h1 id="2">b)What is a difference between W3C HTML5 and WHATWG HTML Living Standard?</h1>
    <p>The main difference between W3C HTML5 and WHATWG HTML Living Standard lies in the development process. W3C HTML5 was developed by the W3C working group, while WHATWG HTML Living Standard was developed by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG). W3C HTML5 is considered a snapshot of WHATWG HTML Living Standard, as it was frozen at a certain point in development.<p>
    
    <h1 id="3">c)What is the minimal HTML page code?</h1>
    <p>The minimal HTML page code is as follows:</p>
<dd>1. Start with an opening HTML tag: "html"
<p>2. Inside the HTML tag, include an opening head tag: "head"</p>
<p>3. Within the head tag, include an opening title tag: "title"</p>
<p>4. Inside the title tag, provide a title for the webpage (e.g., "My Webpage")</p>
<p>5. Close the title tag: "/title"</p>
<p>6. Close the head tag: "/head"</p>
<p>7. Open the body tag: "body"</p>
<p>8. Inside the body tag, add the content of your webpage (e.g., text, images, links)</p>
<p>9. Close the body tag: "/body"</p>
<p>10. Close the HTML tag: "/html"</p></dd>

   <h1 id="4">d)Comment on semantic and presentational markup. Why presentational markup is considered deprecated now?</h1>
    <p>Semantic markup refers to using HTML elements that convey meaning about the content they contain. This helps search engines, screen readers, and other programs better understand the structure and purpose of the content. Presentational markup, on the other hand, refers to using HTML elements solely for visual styling purposes, without conveying any additional meaning. Presentational markup is considered deprecated because it separates the structure and presentation of a web page, making it harder to maintain and update.</p>
    
    <h1 id="5">e)How you can check browser support for particular tag or attribute?</h1>
    <p>To check browser support for a particular tag or attribute, you can use feature detection methods. This can be done using JavaScript by checking if a specific object or property exists in the browser's DOM, or by utilizing libraries like Modernizr that handle feature detection for you.</p>
   
   <h1 id="6">f)What are the audio and video formats, officially supported by HTML standard? What happens if you use other format?</h1>
    <p>The audio and video formats officially supported by the HTML standard are MP3 for audio and MP4 for video. If other formats are used, it might not be supported by all browsers and might require additional plugins or fallback mechanisms to play properly.</p>
